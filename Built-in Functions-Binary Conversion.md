# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
a = 16
result = bin(a)
print(result)


## Output
0b10000

## Result
The number 16 is successfully converted into its binary representation, and the output obtained is 0b10000 using the built-in bin() function in Python.
